				<h2>What are We Talking 'bout? When did it Start?</h2>
					<p className='shadow-lg rounded p-3'>The Ancient Greeks were one of the first to discover a way to harness the beautiful asymmetry found in plants, animals, insects and other natural structures. They expressed this mathematical phenomenon with the Greek letter phi φ, but today, we call it the golden ratio—also known as the divine proportion, the golden mean, and the golden section. </p>
				<h2>What is The Golden Ratio Exactly?</h2>
				<p className='shadow-lg rounded p-3'>The "golden ratio" is a unique mathematical relationship. Two numbers are in the golden ratio if the ratio of the sum of the numbers (a+b) divided by the larger number (a) is equal to the ratio of the larger number divided by the smaller number (a/b).<br></br>
				</p><br></br>
				<p className='shadow-lg rounded p-3'>The golden ratio is about 1.618, and represented by the Greek letter phi, Φ.</p>
					<br></br>
				<p className='shadow-lg rounded p-3'>The golden ratio is best approximated by the famous "Fibonacci numbers." Fibonacci numbers are a never-ending sequence starting with 0 and 1, and continuing by adding the previous two numbers. The next numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, for instance, are 1,2,3, and 5.<br></br>
					<br></br>
					            		0<br></br>
					                    1<br></br>
					                    1 (0 1)<br></br>
					                    2 (1 1)<br></br>
					                    3 (2 1)<br></br>
					                    5 (3 2)<br></br></p>
					<br></br>                    
				<p className='shadow-lg rounded p-3'>The ratios of sequential Fibonacci numbers (2/1, 3/2, 5/3, etc.) approach the golden ratio. In fact, the higher the Fibonacci numbers, the closer their relationship is to 1.618.<br></br>
					<br></br>
					                    2/1 = 2 <br></br>
					                    3/2 = 1.5 <br></br>
					                    5/3 = 1.66666666 . . . <br></br></p>
					                    <br></br>
				<p className='shadow-lg rounded p-3'>The golden ratio is sometimes called the "divine proportion," because of its frequency in the natural world. The number of petals on a flower, for instance, will often be a Fibonacci number. The seeds of sunflowers and pine cones twist in opposing spirals of Fibonacci numbers. Even the sides of an unpeeled banana will usually be a Fibonacci number—and the number of ridges on a peeled banana will usually be a larger Fibonacci number.<br></br></p>
					<br></br>
				<p className='shadow-lg rounded p-3'>The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and proceeds by adding the previous two numbers.<br></br></p>
					    <br></br>
				<p className='shadow-lg rounded p-3'>The so-called "golden rectangle" has appeared in architecture for centuries. Perhaps the most famous golden rectangles are the proportions of the Parthenon in Athens, Greece.<br></br></p>
					    <br></br>
				<p className='shadow-lg rounded p-3'>You ARE a golden ratio! Where do Fibonacci numbers appear on the human body? Think About It!!<br></br>
